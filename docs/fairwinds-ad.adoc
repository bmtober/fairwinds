= pg_playtime: The Fairwinds Game!

'Fairwinds' is a multi-player on-line game that involves real-time, competitive
trading on five simulated markets by using the psql client to enter basic SQL
commands.

This talk will present an overview of the application and discuss some design
and architecture issues underlying its development. 

We will devote the final half of the meeting to actually playing the game, so
bring your computer with network connectivity and the psql client software
ready to connect to a data base server.

You will want to read the "Fairwinds Overview" and "Fairwinds Tutorial" in
advance as well as possibly enjoy the "Fairwinds Equations" reference page.
These documents will prepare you to be a competitive player.

Speaker: Berend Tober has been a PostgreSQL user for over 15 years. His
experience includes both private industry and federal government roles in
systems modeling, network administration, software development and data base
management.
