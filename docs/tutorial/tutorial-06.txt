== Fairwinds Game Tutorial 6 - Cultivation and the Land Journal

The second consequence of Alice engaging in cultivation of her own land
plot is that the land productivity improves.

A record of the productivity improvement is recorded in the land_journal
view:


--------------------------------------------
fairwinds=> select click, serial_number, debit, credit, description 
		from land_journal 
		where fairian_name = 'alice';

 click | serial_number  |  debit   | credit |              description               
-------+----------------+----------+--------+----------------------------------------
     4 | 356a192b7913b0 | 0.000725 |        | land improvement based on cultivation 
     5 | 356a192b7913b0 | 0.000724 |        | land improvement based on cultivation 
     6 | 356a192b7913b0 | 0.000724 |        | land improvement based on cultivation 
     7 | 356a192b7913b0 | 0.000723 |        | land improvement based on cultivation 
(4 rows)
--------------------------------------------

The rows resulting from this query show that during each of clicks 4
through 7, the productivity improved by a small amount. The behavior of
land productivity is very similar to the way proficiency changes as a
'Fairian' engages in activity: when land is cultivated, the productivity
improves, and when left fallow, the productivity diminishes. And in both
cases the amount of change exhibits dimishing returns behavior as the
net balance approaches one or zero, respectively.

Proficiency and productivity together influence the total food
production yield.
