== Fairwinds Game Tutorial B - The Cash Journal

The cash_journal records transactions involving faircoin. For 
example all executed buy and sell transactions, bond issues 
and redemptions, etc. 

There is also a fee imposed for "excessive"
transactions. During each click, a count is maintained of the 
number of transactions each 'Fairian' makes. The first transaction during
each click is free; additional transactions are assessed a fee. The 
amount of the fee increases for each additional transaction
during the click, but the counter is reset to zero when the next 
click begins.

The entire transaction log is available to all 'Fairians' for 
viewing, so 
either Bob or Alice, or any other player, could run this query:


--------------------------------------------
fairwinds=> select click, fairian_name, account, debit, credit, description 
		from cash_journal;

 click | fairian_name | account | debit |   credit   |         description          
-------+--------------+---------+-------+------------+------------------------------
     2 | alice        | land    |       |          0 | Bought land 356a192b7913b0
     7 | bob          | bond    |  1000 |            | Issued bond 1b6453892473a4
     7 | bob          | cost    |       |          1 | Trade order transaction fee
     7 | bob          | land    |       |   0.001028 | Bought land 77de68daecd823
     9 | bob          | bond    |       | 998.998972 | Redeemed bond 1b6453892473a4

--------------------------------------------

This listing shows the zero-cost land purchase by Alice at click 2. Then
several transactions by Bob are recorded. First at click 7 is the 
distribution to Bob of the proceeds of him issuing a bond (which is his 
first transaction during click 7), the transaction fee listed next is 
actually associated with the following transaction when he bought 
land. (The order of items output by the data base is not always what 
you expect, unless you specify an +order by+ clause.).

The bond matured at click 9. 
Since Bob spent some of the money on land and 
additionally incurred a transaction fee, he did not have sufficient 
funds to fully repay the loan.

Note that, from the lenders perspective Bob's cash shortfall is irrelevant.
Bonds are guaranteed investments as far as the lender is concerned. The 
governing market authority creates enough faircoin to fully repay the
lender at bond maturity.

But Bob does not necessarily get let off the hook for the shortfall.
