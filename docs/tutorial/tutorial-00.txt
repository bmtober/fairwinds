== Fairwinds Game Tutorial 0 - Basic Requirements: Client Software

Playing 'Fairwinds' requires that your computer estabilsh a connection to the
game. The preferred way of connecting is with the free +psql+ client software
application. This client is named, and operates the same, on Mac-, Windows- and
Linux-based operating systems.

=== Obtaining PSQL Client Software

==== PSQL on Linux

The +psql+ client is part of the +postgresql+ package. On Linux this is
installed with 

--------------------------------------------
yum install postgresql
--------------------------------------------

==== PSQL on Windows

On Windows systems, +postgresql+ is available through the 'Cygwin' software
tools package. Visit the Cygwin web site https://www.cygwin.com/ to download
and install 'Cygwin'. During the installation, be sure to select the
+postgresql+ package.

After installing Cygwin, double-click the Cygwin icon. This will open a local
terminal window, and at this point the instructions are the same as for running
+psql+ on Linux.

=== PSQL Connection Parameters

The syntax for running the +psql+ command and establishing a game connection is 

--------------------------------------------
psql fairwinds -h fairwinds.btober.net -U fairwinds
--------------------------------------------

where

* the first +fairwinds+ specifies the game name
* the +-h+ option specifes the Internet location where the game is hosted
* the +-U+ option specifies the 'Fairian' name to connect as


The +fairwinds+ user name illustrated with the +-U+ option above is a generic
username that a prospective player may use to establish an initial connection
without requiring a password. The pre-defined +fairwinds+ user account allows
connecting to the game but allows very limited privileges, namely, creating 
a user account. 

If this is the first time you have connected to the game, then you should 
use the +fairwinds+ user account; if you have gone through this process already 
and created a 'Fairian' user account of your own, then you should specify that 
instead.

When you initially connect to the game, this is the interface you are presented
with:
