== Fairwinds Game Tutorial 9 - We Have Company

At this point we introduce a second player, Bob. Bob goes through
similar initial steps as Alice:

Bob creates a Fairian account,

--------------------------------------------
fairwinds=> insert into fairian (fairian_name, passwd, email_address)
        values ('bob', '********', 'bob@example.com');
INSERT 0 1
--------------------------------------------

and then logs in as that new Fairian,

--------------------------------------------
fairwinds=> \c fairwinds bob
Password for user bob: 
--------------------------------------------

Note that upon listing other players, the system does not allow Bob to
see the email address of other registered players, only his own:

--------------------------------------------
fairwinds=> select * from fairian;
 fairian_name | play_level |  email_address  |        created_date        
--------------+------------+-----------------+----------------------------
 bob          | privileged | bob@example.com | 2015-01-24 06:39:49.301221
 alice        | privileged |                 | 2015-01-23 20:55:48.862115
(2 rows)
--------------------------------------------

To list other, currently-connected players, Bob queries the
connection view:

--------------------------------------------
fairwinds=> select * from connection ;
 fairian_name |          login_time           
--------------+-------------------------------
 alice        | 2015-01-23 20:55:48.862115
 bob          | 2015-01-24 06:39:49.301221
(2 rows)
--------------------------------------------

just to see who else is currently playing.

Then he places a market bid order to buy land:

--------------------------------------------
fairwinds=> insert into land_bid default values;
INSERT 0 1
--------------------------------------------

Note Bob has employed the +default values+ shorthand, effectively
specifying and expiration of one and productivity of zero.

As Alice experienced previously, Bob's market order was not stored 
because there were no open land sell orders:

--------------------------------------------
fairwinds=> select * from land_bid;

 expiration | productivity | price | fairian_name 
------------+--------------+-------+--------------
(0 rows)
--------------------------------------------

Similarly, a new land plot (plot \'77de68daecd823') was created by
bootstrapping:

--------------------------------------------
fairwinds=> select * from land;

 serial_number  | productivity | fairian_name 
----------------+--------------+--------------
 356a192b7913b0 |     0.004341 | alice
 77de68daecd823 |              | 
(2 rows)
--------------------------------------------

And that new land appears offered for sale:

--------------------------------------------
fairwinds=> select * from land_ask;

 serial_number  | expiration | productivity |  price   | fairian_name 
----------------+------------+--------------+----------+--------------
 77de68daecd823 |            |            0 | 0.001028 | 
(1 row)
--------------------------------------------

At this point, Bob's experience differs from that of Alice earlier:
This second land plot, rather than being given away free, has a non-zero
price, so Bob needs cash.
