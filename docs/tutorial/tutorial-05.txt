== Fairwinds Game Tutorial 5 - Skills Development and the Skill Journal

Once Alice has engaged herself in cultivation of her own plot of land,
there are a few important implications.

The first important implication is that Alice develops proficiency at a
skill, namely, by engaging in cultivation, she gets better at it.  A
record of her developing skill proficiency is recorded in the skill_journal 
view (note that the game has advanced by three clicks since the contract
issue_date):

--------------------------------------------
fairwinds=> select click, skill_name, debit, credit, description 
				from skill_journal where fairian_name = 'alice';

 click | skill_name |  debit   | credit |                    description                     
-------+------------+----------+--------+----------------------------------------------------
     4 | farmer     | 0.017317 |        | skill improvement based on contract da4b9237bacccd
     5 | farmer     | 0.017017 |        | skill improvement based on contract da4b9237bacccd
     6 | farmer     | 0.016722 |        | skill improvement based on contract da4b9237bacccd
     7 | farmer     | 0.016433 |        | skill improvement based on contract da4b9237bacccd
(4 rows)

--------------------------------------------

Note that in this select query, Alice specified explicity the columns
for viewing.

As in the real world, proficiency at any skill will improve with
practise and will atrophy with neglect. The rows resulting from
querying the skill_journal shows that Alice, engaging in farming, 
improved her proficiency by a small, decreasing amount each
click (proficiency is always a number between zero and one). The growth
and atrophy rates for each skill are small numbers pseudo-randomly fixed
when the game starts.

Her proficiency will continue to improve so long as she is the supplier
to an active labor contract, but the improvement exhibits 'diminishing
returns' as the value approaches unity and will never exceed one. 

Alice can use the sum() aggregation function to add up the changes to
her proficiency and list the net balance:

--------------------------------------------
fairwinds=> select sum(debit) from skill_journal where fairian_name = 'alice';
   sum
---------+
0.067489
(1 row)

--------------------------------------------

When the contract is terminated, her proficiency will atrophy unless she
engages as a supplier on a new contract.

Proficiency atrophies at a constant percentage rate (which also exhibits
diminishing returns behavior in that the amount by which proficiency
decreases each click continually itself diminishes).
