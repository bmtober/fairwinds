== Fairwinds Game Tutorial 4 - Cultivating Self-Owned Land

'Fairians' require sustenance ('i.e.', food) as the game advances.
Provisioning sufficient sustenance has implications that will be
dicussed in subsequent tutorials, but suffice it to say for now that
food is important, just like in the real world.

Sustenance is derived from plots of land by cultivation (or 'farming' in
game terminology). The activity of cultivation is an example of
skilled labor, and 'Fairwinds' labor activity is executed under contract. 

Labor contracts are recorded in the +work+ relation. Normally, a labor
contract is made between two 'Fairians': a customer (the land-owning
buyer of a labor contract seeking to employ others) and a 
supplier (the seller of a labor contract seeking to earn 
'faircoin' by working for another 'Fairian').

That more typical, competitive/cooperative arrangement is the topic of a
later tutorial.

This tutorial explains how a 'Fairian' can engage in cultivation of
their own land.  The self-owned land cultivation scenario is less
complicated than labor contracts between 'Fairians' because the land
owner is both the customer and the supplier, and neither bidding nor
exchange of money is involved: A contract for self-owned land labor is
added directly to the work table without using the market bid/ask
process.

Alice reminds herself of the +work+ view structure:

--------------------------------------------
fairwinds=> \dS work
                  View "privileged.work"
     Column      |         Type          | Modifiers 
-----------------+-----------------------+-----------
 contract_number | character varying(14) | 
 issue_date      | bigint                | 
 term            | bigint                | 
 customer        | name                  | 
 supplier        | name                  | 
 work_place      | name                  | 
 active          | boolean               | 
 skill_name      | private.skill_type    | 
--------------------------------------------

and sees eight columns. The contract_number, issue_date, and active
column values are determined automatically when a labor contract is
created.  As mentioned above, the customer and supplier will both
automatially be set to the land-owning 'Fairian'. The term will be
automatically set to a value of $1$ (which is discussed further below). 

Only the work_place and skill_name need be specified for the self-owned
land cultivation scenario.

The work_place should be specified as the serial_number value
corresponding to the land to be cultivated. The skill_name corresponding
to land cultivation is "farmer". (Currently "farmer" is the only skill
category, but future game versions will expand to include other
categories.)

The term column specifies the minimum
time period committment (in clicks) that the labor supplier makes to the
customer. That is, while the customer can terminate a labor contract at
any time, the supplier can do so only after the contract term has
expired. For the self-owned land scenario, since the land owner is both
customer and supplier there is no need to limit the authority to
terminate the labor contract, so a value of one is automatically
assigned, and it need not be specified in the insert statement.

Note, though, that a labor contract does not terminate automatically
upon time advancing beyond the contract term. The supplier will
continue in the activity of cultivation on the contracted plot of land
until one or the other party to the contract explicitly de-activates
the contract by changing the active attribute to false. Consequently,
it makes no sense for the self-owned land labor contract to set
the value to anything larger than one.

Alice embarks on cultivation by creating a self-owned land labor
contract with herself using an insert statement:

--------------------------------------------
fairwinds=> insert into work (work_place,skill_name) values ('356a192b7913b0','farmer');
INSERT 0 1
--------------------------------------------

As described above, Alice has specified the land plot serial number and
the skill category and then confirms the labor contract entry by
listing the work view:

--------------------------------------------
fairwinds=> select * from work;

 contract_number | issue_date | term | customer | supplier |   work_place   | active | skill_name
-----------------+------------+------+----------+----------+----------------+--------+------------
 da4b9237bacccd  |          3 |    1 | alice    | alice    | 356a192b7913b0 | t      | farmer
(1 row)

--------------------------------------------
			
A contract_number has been assigned to serve as unique identifier and the 
contract is annotated as active.
