== Fairwinds Game Tutorial 1 - Creating a user account

When you initially connect to the game, this is the interface you are
presented with:

--------------------------------------------
fairwinds=>
--------------------------------------------

This is the game waiting for you to make a move, 'i.e.', to enter a
command specifying what you want to accomplish. This tutorial will
demonstrate basic commands for listing information about the game and
creating a new 'Fairian' user account.

Commands to list technical information about the environment generally
start with a back-slash ("+\+") character. 

For example, you can display a list of currently-visible relations with
the +\d+ command: 

--------------------------------------------
fairwinds=> \d
           List of relations
 Schema |    Name    | Type |  Owner
--------+------------+------+----------
 public | fairian    | view | postgres
(1 row)
--------------------------------------------

This table shows the fairian view defined in the 'public' schema. A schema
serves to limit what game elements are visible to, and the  privileges
available on, those elements. 'public' in this context means that this 
is visible to anyone connecting to the game even if they do
not have an account. The public schema presents very limited
functionality, namely the ability to create a
new account, as described below.

In addition to the technical information commands demonstrated so far,
you will utilize structured query language (SQL) commands to actually
play the game, and more pertinenty for our present interest, to
create an account. 

The first command you will learn is the +insert+ command, which, as the
name implies adds data to a relation. This is how you create a
'Fairian', but to do so, you first need to know what data to add.

Use the +\dS+ command to the display the structure of the fairian
view:

--------------------------------------------
fairwinds=> \dS fairian
      View "public.fairian"
    Column     | Type | Modifiers
---------------+------+-----------
 fairian_name  | name |
 passwd        | name |
 email_address | name |
--------------------------------------------

This listing shows that the fairian view has three columns. You must
specify values for each of these in order to insert a new entry, thereby
creating an account to play 'Fairwinds'.

Here is an example of the insert command to create a 'Fairian' named
"alice":


--------------------------------------------
fairwinds=> insert into fairian (fairian_name, passwd, email_address) 
        values ('alice', '*******', 'alice@example.com');
INSERT 0 1
--------------------------------------------

The passwd column value is shown as asteriks for illustration only. In
actuality you would specify a password. An email address is important so
that you can receive news and announcements about the game.

The +INSERT 0 1+ response indicates successful addition of your account
information.

At this point you can re-connect to the game as your new 'Fairian' with
the +\c+ command:

--------------------------------------------
\c fairwinds alice
--------------------------------------------
 

or you can terminate your connection with the +\q+ command.
